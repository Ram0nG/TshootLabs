  The following scenario introduced the trouble tickets:
	You work for School Networking. and a University. is a customer of your company.
	Dano, the customer engineer, has sent you an email, asking for your help.
	• The senior customer engineer noticed that GW1 only has one OSPF neighbor, GW2.
	This engineer has asked Dano why GW1 does not have an adjacency with R1.
	Dano needs your help in solving this issue. He does not have the expertise to
  tackle this issue.
	• Dano has configured all the routers in the network with remote access via 
  SSH version 2.
	Now when he tests connectivity from his PC, PC4, he can access GW1, GW2, and R1,
  but not R2.
	The connection is refused and Dano is requesting you help in investigating
  the reason for this failure.
	• Routers R1 and R2 keep complaining about a duplicate IP address.
	Dano does not know the cause of this issue. He insists that this failure is
  an IOS bug since all PCs have proper Internet connectivity.
